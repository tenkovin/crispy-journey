# This folder contains GROMACS formatted CHARMM36 force fields, a pre-optimized PDB structure, and GROMACS inputs.
# All input files were optimized for GROMACS 2019.2 or above, so lower version of GROMACS can cause some errors.
# We adopted the Verlet cut-off scheme for all minimization, equilibration, and production steps because it is 
# faster and more accurate than the group scheme. If you have a trouble with a performance of Verlet scheme while 
# running parallelized simulation, you should check if you are using appropriate command line.
# For MPI parallelizing, we recommand following command:
# mpirun -np $NUM_CPU gmx mdrun -ntomp 1


set init = $1_solv_ions
set rest_prefix = $1_solv_ions
set mini_prefix = step0_minimization
set equi_prefix = step%d_equilibration


# Minimization
# In the case that there is a problem during minimization using a single precision of GROMACS, please try to use 
# a double precision of GROMACS only for the minimization step.
